# Rock Paper Scissors Game üéÆ

This is my **first JavaScript project** for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Description

It's a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game that is played entirely in the **browser console** for now. The player plays against the computer in a best-of-five format.

This project is a great introduction to basic JavaScript concepts like:

- Variables and functions
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- DOM interaction (in future updates)

## How to Play

1. Open your browser.
2. Press `F12` or right-click and select **Inspect**, then go to the **Console** tab.
3. Run the script and follow the prompts to play.

## What's Next

- Add a user interface using HTML/CSS.
- Allow users to click buttons instead of typing in the console.
